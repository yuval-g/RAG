# Deployment Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive guides for deploying the RAG Engine in different environments and platforms.

## Table of Contents

- [Docker Deployment](./docker.md) - Deploying with Docker and Docker Compose
- [Kubernetes Deployment](./kubernetes.md) - Deploying on Kubernetes clusters
- [Bare Metal Deployment](./bare-metal.md) - Deploying directly on servers
- [Cloud Providers](./cloud-providers.md) - Deploying on cloud platforms

## Getting Started

If you're new to deploying the RAG Engine:

1. For local development and testing, start with [Docker Deployment](./docker.md)
2. For production environments, choose the appropriate guide based on your infrastructure:
   - [Docker Deployment](./docker.md) for containerized deployments
   - [Kubernetes Deployment](./kubernetes.md) for orchestrated container deployments
   - [Bare Metal Deployment](./bare-metal.md) for direct server installations
   - [Cloud Providers](./cloud-providers.md) for cloud-specific guidance

## Deployment Options

### Local Development
- [Docker Deployment](./docker.md) - Recommended for local development with easy setup

### Production Environments
- [Docker Deployment](./docker.md) - For simple containerized production deployments
- [Kubernetes Deployment](./kubernetes.md) - For scalable, orchestrated deployments
- [Bare Metal Deployment](./bare-metal.md) - For maximum control and performance
- [Cloud Providers](./cloud-providers.md) - For managed cloud services

## Choosing the Right Deployment Method

### Docker
Best for:
- Simple deployments
- Development and testing
- Small to medium-scale production
- Teams familiar with containerization

### Kubernetes
Best for:
- Large-scale deployments
- High availability requirements
- Auto-scaling needs
- Complex microservices architectures

### Bare Metal
Best for:
- Maximum performance requirements
- Full control over the environment
- Compliance requirements
- Existing server infrastructure

### Cloud Providers
Best for:
- Rapid deployment
- Managed services
- Variable workloads
- Teams preferring managed infrastructure

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
1. Reviewed the [Configuration Documentation](../configuration/)
2. Set up required API keys and credentials
3. Chosen appropriate [hardware requirements](./system-requirements.md)
4. Planned your [security configuration](../configuration/security.md)
