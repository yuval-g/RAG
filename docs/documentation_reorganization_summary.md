# Documentation Reorganization Summary

This document summarizes the improvements made to the RAG Engine documentation structure to better organize user and developer documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved Main Documentation Structure
- Updated `/docs/README.md` to clearly separate User Documentation and Developer Documentation
- Created better navigation with quick links for both users and developers
- Added documentation philosophy section

### 2. Enhanced Development Documentation
- Created `/docs/development/README.md` to organize all developer-focused content
- Moved `error_handling_and_resilience.md` from `/docs/` to `/docs/development/`
- Updated links in related documents to reflect the new location

### 3. Improved User Guides Organization
- Created `/docs/user-guides/README.md` to better organize user-focused content
- Added structure for tutorials and use cases (to be populated)

### 4. Enhanced Examples Documentation
- Created `/docs/examples/README.md` with better organization of example categories
- Maintained references to actual example files in the project's `examples/` directory

### 5. Added README Files to Key Directories
- `/docs/architecture/README.md` - Overview of architecture documentation
- `/docs/configuration/README.md` - Overview of configuration documentation
- `/docs/deployment/README.md` - Overview of deployment documentation
- `/docs/operations/README.md` - Overview of operations documentation
- `/docs/api-reference/README.md` - Overview of API documentation
- `/docs/getting-started/README.md` - Overview of getting started guides
- `/docs/user-guides/tutorials/README.md` - Placeholder for future tutorials
- `/docs/user-guides/use-cases/README.md` - Placeholder for future use cases

### 6. Fixed Broken Links
- Updated references to `error_handling_and_resilience.md` in:
  - `/docs/user-guides/advanced-features.md`
  - `/docs/configuration/security.md`
- Removed duplicate section in `/docs/user-guides/advanced-features.md`
- Removed broken reference to non-existent `GROUNDING_FEATURES_SUMMARY.md`

### 7. Updated Project Map
- Completely rewrote `/docs/PROJECT_MAP.md` to provide a clear visual representation of the project structure
- Included both file system structure and documentation organization
- Added key documentation paths for different user types

## Benefits of the Reorganization

1. **Clear Separation**: Distinct sections for user and developer documentation
2. **Better Navigation**: README files in each directory provide context and navigation
3. **Improved Discoverability**: Users can easily find what they need
4. **Logical Grouping**: Related content is grouped together
5. **Future-Ready**: Structure accommodates future documentation additions
6. **Link Integrity**: All internal links have been verified and updated

## Documentation Structure Overview

### For Users
- Getting Started guides
- User Guides (basic and advanced)
- API Reference
- Configuration documentation
- Deployment guides
- Operations guides
- Examples

### For Developers
- Contributing guide
- Development setup

This reorganization makes it easier for both users and developers to find the information they need while maintaining a clean, organized structure that can grow with the project.
