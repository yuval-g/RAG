# Security Configuration and Best Practices

This guide outlines the security features and recommended practices for deploying and operating the RAG System securely.

## Overview

Security is a critical aspect of any production system. The RAG System provides various configuration options and adheres to best practices to help you secure your deployment, protect sensitive data, and ensure the integrity and availability of your services.

## 1. Authentication and Authorization

Control who can access your RAG API and what actions they can perform.

### API Key Authentication

The simplest form of authentication, where clients provide a unique API key with their requests.

**Configuration (in `config.yaml` or via environment variables):**
```yaml
security:
  enable_auth: true
  auth_type: "api_key"
  api_key_header: "Authorization" # Header where the API key is expected (e.g., Bearer YOUR_API_KEY)
```

**Usage:**
Include your API key in the `Authorization` header (or configured header):
```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication (Planned/Advanced)

For more robust authentication, especially in microservices architectures, JWTs can be used.

**Configuration:**
```yaml
security:
  auth_type: "jwt"
  jwt:
    secret_key: "${JWT_SECRET}" # Use environment variable for secret
    algorithm: "HS256"
    expiry: 3600 # Token expiry in seconds
```

## 2. Data Security

Protecting your data at rest and in transit is paramount.

### Encryption

*   **Encryption at Rest**: Ensure that data stored in your vector database (e.g., Chroma persistent directory, Pinecone/Weaviate data) and any other persistent storage is encrypted. Most cloud providers offer disk encryption by default or as an option.
    ```yaml
security:
  encryption:
    enable_at_rest: true
    algorithm: "AES-256" # Example, actual implementation depends on storage
    ```
*   **Encryption in Transit (HTTPS/TLS)**: All communication with the RAG API should use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
    ```yaml
security:
  encryption:
    enable_in_transit: true
    ```

### Data Privacy (PII Detection & Masking)

If your documents contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), consider implementing PII detection and masking.

**Configuration:**
```yaml
security:
  privacy:
    enable_pii_detection: true
    mask_sensitive_data: true
    retention_days: 90 # Data retention policy
```

## 3. Network Security

Secure the network access to your RAG System.

### HTTPS/TLS

Always enable HTTPS in production environments to encrypt communication between clients and the API server.

**Configuration:**
```yaml
security:
  tls:
    enabled: true
    cert_file: "/etc/ssl/certs/server.crt" # Path to your SSL certificate
    key_file: "/etc/ssl/private/server.key" # Path to your SSL private key
    min_version: "TLSv1.2" # Minimum TLS version
```

### Firewall Rules

Configure firewalls (e.g., cloud security groups, `ufw`, `iptables`) to allow traffic only on necessary ports (e.g., 80/443 for Nginx, 8000 for RAG API if directly exposed) and from trusted IP ranges.

**Configuration:**
```yaml
security:
  firewall:
    allowed_ips: ["10.0.0.0/8", "192.168.0.0/16"] # Example trusted IPs
    blocked_ips: []
```

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

Control which web domains are allowed to make requests to your API.

**Configuration:**
```yaml
security:
  cors:
    enabled: true
    origins: ["https://yourdomain.com", "https://anotherdomain.com"] # Specific allowed origins
    methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]
    headers: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"]
```

## 4. Container and Kubernetes Security

If deploying with Docker or Kubernetes, apply container-specific security best practices.

### Container Security

*   **Use Official and Slim Images**: Base your Docker images on official, minimal base images (e.g., `python:3.13-slim`).
*   **Non-root User**: Run containers with a dedicated non-root user.
*   **Read-only Filesystem**: Where possible, mount the container's root filesystem as read-only.
*   **Limit Capabilities**: Drop unnecessary Linux capabilities and add only what's essential.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regularly scan your Docker images for known vulnerabilities.

### Kubernetes Security

*   **Pod Security Standards**: Apply Pod Security Standards to namespaces to enforce security policies.
*   **Network Policies**: Control traffic flow between pods and network endpoints.
*   **Security Context**: Define security contexts for pods and containers to restrict privileges.
*   **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Implement fine-grained RBAC to control what users and service accounts can do within the cluster.
*   **Secrets Management**: Use Kubernetes Secrets or external secret management solutions.

**Relevant Documentation:**
*   [Docker Deployment Guide](../deployment/docker.md)
*   [Kubernetes Deployment Guide](../deployment/kubernetes.md)

## 5. Secrets Management

Never hardcode sensitive information like API keys or database credentials directly in your code or configuration files. Use secure methods for managing secrets.

*   **Environment Variables**: Load secrets from environment variables (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY=${GOOGLE_API_KEY}`).
*   **`.env` files**: For local development, use `.env` files (but ensure they are `.gitignore`d).
*   **Docker Secrets**: For Docker Swarm deployments.
*   **Kubernetes Secrets**: For Kubernetes deployments.
*   **External Secret Management Systems**: For production, integrate with dedicated secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or GCP Secret Manager.

**Relevant Documentation:**
*   [Environment Setup Guide](../environment-setup.md)

## 6. Rate Limiting

Protect your API from abuse and denial-of-service attacks by implementing rate limiting.

**Configuration:**
```yaml
security:
  rate_limiting:
    enabled: true
    requests_per_minute: 100
    burst_size: 20
```

**Relevant Documentation:**
*   [Error Handling and Resilience](../../error_handling_and_resilience.md) (details on Rate Limiter implementation)

## 7. Input Validation and Sanitization

Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) and ensure data integrity.

**Configuration:**
```yaml
security:
  validation:
    max_request_size: "10MB" # Limit maximum request body size
    max_query_length: 1000 # Limit maximum query string length
    sanitize_input: true # Enable input sanitization (implementation dependent)
```

## 8. Audit Logging

Enable comprehensive audit logging to track who accessed what, when, and from where. This is crucial for security monitoring and forensics.

**Configuration:**
```yaml
security:
  audit:
    enabled: true
    log_requests: true
    log_responses: false # Avoid logging sensitive response content
    log_file: "/app/logs/audit.log"
```

## 9. Security Best Practices Checklist

*   [ ] **Regularly update dependencies**: Keep all libraries and frameworks up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   [ ] **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the necessary permissions to users, services, and containers.
*   [ ] **Secure Configuration**: Review and harden all default configurations.
*   [ ] **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to prevent information leakage in error messages.
*   [ ] **Monitoring and Alerting**: Set up alerts for suspicious activities, high error rates, or unauthorized access attempts.
*   [ ] **Regular Security Audits/Penetration Testing**: Periodically conduct security assessments.
*   [ ] **Incident Response Plan**: Have a clear plan for responding to security incidents.
*   [ ] **Data Backup and Recovery**: Implement a robust backup strategy for all critical data.
*   [ ] **Secure Development Lifecycle**: Integrate security into your development process from design to deployment.
