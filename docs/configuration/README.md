# Configuration Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation about configuring the RAG Engine for different environments and use cases.

## Table of Contents

- [Configuration Reference](./configuration-reference.md) - Complete reference for all configuration options
- [Environment Setup](./environment-setup.md) - Setting up environment variables
- [Performance Tuning](./performance-tuning.md) - Optimizing performance through configuration
- [Security](./security.md) - Security configuration and best practices

## Getting Started

If you're new to configuring the RAG Engine:

1. Start with [Environment Setup](./environment-setup.md) to understand how to configure your environment
2. Review the [Configuration Reference](./configuration-reference.md) for a complete list of options
3. Learn about [Security](./security.md) configuration for production deployments
4. Optimize your setup with [Performance Tuning](./performance-tuning.md)

## Configuration Approaches

The RAG Engine supports multiple configuration approaches:

1. **Configuration Files** - YAML files for different environments (development, production, etc.)
2. **Environment Variables** - Override file settings with environment variables
3. **Runtime Parameters** - Override all other settings with runtime parameters

For detailed information about the configuration hierarchy and precedence, see the [Configuration Reference](./configuration-reference.md).

## For Different Environments

### Development
For local development, focus on:
- [Environment Setup](./environment-setup.md)
- Basic configuration options in [Configuration Reference](./configuration-reference.md)

### Production
For production deployments, pay special attention to:
- [Security](./security.md) configuration
- [Performance Tuning](./performance-tuning.md)
- Environment-specific settings in [Configuration Reference](./configuration-reference.md)
