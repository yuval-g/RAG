# Documentation Link Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the broken link fixes made to improve the RAG Engine documentation.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Broken Links to Non-existent deployment_guide.md

**Problem**: Two documentation files contained links to a `deployment_guide.md` file that didn't exist:
- `/home/yuval/Documents/Projects/RAG/docs/deployment/bare-metal.md` - Line 17
- `/home/yuval/Documents/Projects/RAG/docs/deployment/cloud-providers.md` - Line 15

**Fix Applied**: 
- Updated links to point to existing documentation in `/docs/deployment/docker.md#prerequisites`
- This provides users with the actual system requirements and prerequisites information

**Before**:
```markdown
[Prerequisites](../../deployment_guide.md#prerequisites)
[System Requirements](../../deployment_guide.md#system-requirements)
```

**After**:
```markdown
[Prerequisites](./docker.md#prerequisites)
[Prerequisites](./docker.md#prerequisites)
```

### 2. Incorrect Relative Path in Examples Documentation

**Problem**: 
- `/home/yuval/Documents/Projects/RAG/docs/examples/README.md` contained an incorrect relative link to the examples README

**Fix Applied**:
- Corrected the relative path from `../../examples/README.md` to `../examples/README.md`

**Before**:
```markdown
[Examples README](../../examples/README.md)
```

**After**:
```markdown
[Examples README](../examples/README.md)
```

## Verification

All links have been verified to work correctly:

1. ✅ Main README.md directory links
2. ✅ Main README.md file links  
3. ✅ Development documentation links
4. ✅ Examples README links
5. ✅ No remaining references to `deployment_guide.md`
6. ✅ No broken relative links with `../..` patterns

## Files Modified

1. `/docs/deployment/bare-metal.md` - Fixed link to system requirements
2. `/docs/deployment/cloud-providers.md` - Fixed link to prerequisites
3. `/docs/examples/README.md` - Fixed relative path to examples README

## Testing Performed

- Verified all directory links exist
- Verified all file links exist
- Confirmed correct relative paths for nested directory structures
- Checked that no broken links remain in the documentation
