# Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the RAG System architecture.

## System Components

The RAG System is composed of several key components that work together to provide a complete retrieval-augmented generation solution:

### 1. Core Engine
The central component that orchestrates the entire RAG pipeline:
- Manages the document lifecycle (indexing, retrieval, generation)
- Coordinates between different providers
- Handles configuration and system state

### 2. Providers
Pluggable components that abstract external services:
- **LLM Providers**: Interface with language models (OpenAI, Google, etc.)
- **Embedding Providers**: Generate embeddings for documents and queries
- **Vector Store Providers**: Manage document storage and retrieval

### 3. Pipelines
Specialized processing workflows:
- **Indexing Pipeline**: Processes and stores documents
- **Query Pipeline**: Handles user queries and generates responses
- **Retrieval Pipeline**: Finds relevant documents for queries

### 4. Interfaces
Different ways to interact with the system:
- **CLI**: Command-line interface for direct usage
- **REST API**: HTTP API for integration with other systems
- **Python SDK**: Library for embedding in Python applications

## Data Flow

1. **Document Ingestion**: Documents are ingested from various sources (files, web, databases)
2. **Processing**: Documents are chunked, embedded, and stored in vector databases
3. **Query Processing**: User queries are embedded and matched against stored documents
4. **Retrieval**: Relevant documents are retrieved based on similarity
5. **Generation**: LLM generates a response using retrieved context
6. **Response**: Final response is returned to the user

## Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Components are loosely coupled and easily replaceable
- **Extensibility**: New providers and features can be added without major changes
- **Resilience**: Built-in error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities
- **Performance**: Optimized for both speed and resource efficiency

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.13+
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI (API), Click (CLI)
- **Vector Stores**: ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate (pluggable)
- **LLMs**: OpenAI, Google Gemini (pluggable)
- **Dependencies**: Langchain, Pydantic, Rich, etc.

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture supports horizontal scaling through:
- Stateless API servers
- Distributed vector stores
- Asynchronous processing pipelines
- Caching mechanisms
