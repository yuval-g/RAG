# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains documentation about the RAG Engine's system architecture, design patterns, and component structure.

## Table of Contents

- [Architecture Overview](./overview.md) - High-level system architecture
- [Design Patterns](./design-patterns.md) - Key design patterns used in the system
- [Components](./components.md) - Detailed documentation of system components
- [Data Flow](./data-flow.md) - How data moves through the system

## Getting Started

If you're new to understanding the RAG Engine architecture:

1. Start with the [Architecture Overview](./overview.md) for a high-level view
2. Explore the [Design Patterns](./design-patterns.md) to understand key implementation approaches
3. Review the [Components](./components.md) documentation for detailed information about each part
4. Understand how data flows through the system with the [Data Flow](./data-flow.md) documentation

## Architecture Decision Records

For documentation of specific architectural decisions, see the [Architecture Decisions](../development/architecture-decisions/) directory in the development documentation.

## For Contributors

If you're contributing to the RAG Engine, understanding the architecture is essential. The documentation in this directory will help you:

- Understand how components interact
- Follow established design patterns
- Make changes that align with the overall architecture
- Contribute new features that integrate well with existing components

For development setup and contribution guidelines, see the [Development Documentation](../development/).
