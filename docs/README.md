## Documentation Philosophy

Our documentation follows these principles:

1. **Task-Based**: Organized around what you want to accomplish
2. **Progressive**: Start simple and build complexity
3. **Complete**: Comprehensive coverage of all features
4. **Maintained**: Regularly updated with code changes
5. **Accessible**: Clear language and examples
