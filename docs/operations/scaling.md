# Scaling Guide

This guide provides strategies and considerations for scaling the RAG System to meet increasing demands for throughput, latency, and data volume.

## Overview

Scaling is the process of adjusting system resources to handle a growing workload. The RAG System is designed with scalability in mind, supporting both horizontal and vertical scaling approaches.

## 1. Scaling Principles

*   **Statelessness**: The RAG API server is designed to be largely stateless, making it easy to scale horizontally.
*   **Modularity**: Components like LLM providers, embedding providers, and vector stores are pluggable, allowing you to choose scalable external services.
*   **Asynchronous Processing**: Leveraging async operations helps maximize resource utilization and throughput.
*   **Caching**: Reduces the load on backend services and improves response times.

## 2. Horizontal Scaling

Horizontal scaling involves adding more instances of your application or services to distribute the load. This is the preferred method for achieving high availability and handling large traffic volumes.

### 2.1. Scaling the RAG API Server

*   **Docker Compose**: Use `deploy.replicas` in a `docker-compose.override.yml` to run multiple instances of the `rag-engine` service.
    ```yaml
    # docker-compose.override.yml
    version: '3.8'
    services:
      rag-engine:
        deploy:
          replicas: 3 # Scale to 3 instances
    ```
*   **Kubernetes**: Configure the `replicas` field in your Deployment manifest or use a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).
    ```yaml
    # Kubernetes Deployment snippet
    spec:
      replicas: 3 # Start with 3 replicas
    ```

### 2.2. Load Balancing

When scaling horizontally, a load balancer is essential to distribute incoming requests evenly across your RAG API instances.

*   **Nginx**: Can be used as a reverse proxy and load balancer for Docker Compose deployments.
*   **Cloud Load Balancers**: Utilize managed load balancing services (e.g., AWS ALB/NLB, GCP Cloud Load Balancing, Azure Load Balancer/Application Gateway) for cloud deployments.
*   **Kubernetes Ingress**: An Ingress Controller (e.g., Nginx Ingress Controller) handles external access and load balancing within a Kubernetes cluster.

### 2.3. Auto-scaling

Automate the scaling process based on predefined metrics.

*   **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** (Kubernetes): Automatically adjusts the number of RAG Engine pods based on CPU utilization, memory usage, or custom metrics (e.g., requests per second).
*   **Cluster Autoscaler** (Kubernetes): Automatically adjusts the number of nodes in your cluster based on pending pods.

**Relevant Documentation:**
*   [Docker Deployment Guide](../deployment/docker.md) (Scaling section)
*   [Kubernetes Deployment Guide](../deployment/kubernetes.md) (Auto-scaling section)

## 3. Vertical Scaling

Vertical scaling involves increasing the resources (CPU, RAM) of existing instances. This can be a quick solution for moderate increases in load but has limits and can lead to higher costs.

*   **VMs/Bare Metal**: Upgrade the server hardware (CPU, RAM).
*   **Docker**: Adjust resource limits in `docker-compose.yml`.
    ```yaml
    # Docker Compose resource limits
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '2.0'
          memory: 4G
    ```
*   **Kubernetes**: Adjust resource requests and limits in Deployment manifests or use a Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA).

**Relevant Documentation:**
*   [Kubernetes Deployment Guide](../deployment/kubernetes.md) (Vertical Pod Autoscaler section)

## 4. Component-Specific Scaling

Scaling the RAG System often involves scaling its individual components.

### 4.1. Vector Store Scaling

*   **ChromaDB**: For local deployments, ensure sufficient disk I/O and CPU. For larger datasets, consider running ChromaDB in a dedicated server or cluster mode. For very large-scale production, managed cloud vector databases are recommended.
*   **Managed Vector Databases (Pinecone, Weaviate Cloud)**: These services are designed for high scalability and handle the underlying infrastructure, allowing you to scale by adjusting your plan or instance types.

### 4.2. Redis Cache Scaling

*   **Redis Standalone**: Sufficient for many use cases. Ensure enough RAM and CPU.
*   **Redis Cluster**: For high availability and larger datasets, deploy a Redis Cluster.
*   **Managed Redis Services**: Use cloud-managed Redis services (e.g., AWS ElastiCache, GCP Memorystore, Azure Cache for Redis) for simplified scaling and management.

### 4.3. LLM and Embedding Providers

Scaling for LLM and embedding providers typically involves relying on the provider's infrastructure. Ensure your API keys have sufficient quotas and monitor usage.

*   **Batching**: Utilize batch processing for embedding generation and LLM calls to reduce API overhead and improve throughput.
*   **Connection Pooling**: Maintain persistent connections to providers to reduce connection setup overhead.

## 5. Performance Monitoring for Scaling

Effective scaling requires continuous monitoring to identify bottlenecks and validate the impact of scaling actions.

*   **Key Metrics**: Monitor CPU utilization, memory usage, network I/O, disk I/O, request rates (RPS), latency (P95, P99), and error rates.
*   **RAG-Specific Metrics**: Track `rag_query_duration_seconds`, `rag_queries_total`, `rag_confidence_score`, and `rag_retrieved_docs_count`.
*   **Tools**: Use Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization and alerting.

*   [Monitoring and Health Checks](../operations/monitoring.md)
*   [Performance Optimization](../configuration/performance-tuning.md)

## 6. Scaling Best Practices

*   **Start Small, Scale Incrementally**: Begin with a modest deployment and scale up or out as demand grows.
*   **Automate Scaling**: Implement auto-scaling mechanisms (HPA, Cluster Autoscaler) to respond dynamically to workload changes.
*   **Monitor Continuously**: Use comprehensive monitoring to detect performance bottlenecks and validate scaling effectiveness.
*   **Test Under Load**: Conduct load testing to understand your system's limits and identify breaking points before they occur in production.
*   **Optimize Components**: Ensure individual components (e.g., chunk size, retrieval `k`, caching) are tuned for optimal performance.
*   **Plan for Failure**: Design for redundancy and high availability to ensure the system remains operational even if some instances fail.
*   **Cost Management**: Balance performance requirements with cost considerations when choosing scaling strategies and managed services.
