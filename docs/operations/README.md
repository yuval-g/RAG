# Operations Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive guides for operating, monitoring, and maintaining the RAG Engine in production environments.

## Table of Contents

- [Monitoring and Health Checks](./monitoring.md) - Monitoring system health and performance
- [Maintenance](./maintenance.md) - Routine maintenance tasks and procedures
- [Scaling](./scaling.md) - Scaling the system for increased demand

## Getting Started

If you're new to operating the RAG Engine:

1. Start with [Monitoring and Health Checks](./monitoring.md) to understand how to monitor your deployment
2. Refer to the [FAQ section](../faq/troubleshooting.md) for common issues and troubleshooting.
3. Set up [Maintenance](./maintenance.md) procedures for ongoing system care
4. Plan for [Scaling](./scaling.md) as your usage grows

## Operations Lifecycle

### Day 1: Initial Setup
- Configure monitoring as described in [Monitoring and Health Checks](./monitoring.md)
- Set up alerting for critical system metrics
- Establish baseline performance metrics

### Day 2: Ongoing Operations
- Regular [Maintenance](./maintenance.md) tasks
- Continuous [Monitoring](./monitoring.md) of system health
- Performance optimization using [Scaling](./scaling.md) strategies

### When Issues Arise
- Use the [troubleshooting guide in the FAQ section](../faq/troubleshooting.md) to diagnose and resolve problems
- Check logs and metrics for error patterns
- Follow escalation procedures for critical issues
