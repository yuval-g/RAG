# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the RAG System. ADRs are short, lightweight documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the project's development.

## Purpose of ADRs

ADRs serve several purposes:

*   **Record Decisions**: Document the context, decision, and consequences of significant architectural choices.
*   **Provide Rationale**: Explain *why* a particular decision was made, including alternatives considered and trade-offs.
*   **Historical Context**: Offer a historical log of architectural evolution, useful for new team members or future reference.
*   **Communication**: Serve as a communication tool for stakeholders to understand key design choices.

## How to Use This Directory

Each ADR is a Markdown file named with a sequential number and a descriptive title (e.g., `0001-use-fastapi-for-api.md`).

When making a significant architectural decision, a new ADR should be created following a template.

## ADR Template

```markdown
# <ADR Number>. <Decision Title>

## Status

<Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by [ADR-XXXX] | Deprecated>

## Context

Describe the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. What is the problem that we're trying to solve?

## Decision

Describe the decision that was made. What is the chosen solution?

## Consequences

Describe the positive and negative consequences of the decision. What are the trade-offs? What are the implications for other parts of the system?

## Alternatives Considered

*   **Alternative 1**: Brief description and reasons for not choosing it.
*   **Alternative 2**: Brief description and reasons for not choosing it.
