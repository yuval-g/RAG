This section contains all the documentation needed for developers who want to contribute to the RAG Engine or extend its functionality.

## Table of Contents

- [Contributing Guide](./contributing.md) - How to contribute to the project
- [Development Setup](./development-setup.md) - Setting up your development environment
- [Coding Standards](./coding-standards.md) - Code style and quality guidelines
- [Testing](./testing.md) - How to write and run tests
- [Architecture Decisions](./architecture-decisions/) - Records of major architectural decisions

## Getting Started

If you're new to contributing to the RAG Engine, start with:

1. [Development Setup](./development-setup.md) - Set up your environment
2. [Contributing Guide](./contributing.md) - Learn how to contribute
3. [Coding Standards](./coding-standards.md) - Understand our code standards

## Architecture Documentation

For understanding how the RAG Engine works under the hood:

- [Architecture Overview](../architecture/overview.md) - High-level system architecture
- [Design Patterns](../architecture/design-patterns.md) - Key design patterns used
- [Components](../architecture/components.md) - Detailed component documentation
- [Data Flow](../architecture/data-flow.md) - How data moves through the system
- [Architecture Decisions](./architecture-decisions/) - Why we made key architectural choices

## Development Workflow

1. Set up your development environment
2. Familiarize yourself with the codebase using the [Project Map](../PROJECT_MAP.md)
3. Follow the [coding standards](./coding-standards.md)
4. Write tests for your changes as described in [Testing](./testing.md)
5. Submit your contribution following the [Contributing Guide](./contributing.md)

## Tools and Practices

- We use `uv` for dependency management
- Code formatting with `black`
- Linting with `ruff`
- Testing with `pytest`
- Type checking with `mypy`
- Documentation with Markdown
